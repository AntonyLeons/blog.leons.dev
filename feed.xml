Here‚Äôs my predictions on how the industry will evolve in the next century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;renewable-energy&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/renewables.jpg#full&quot; alt=&quot;Solar panels&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean renewable energy will be the energy of the future, there are already entire countries that are fully renewable like Costa Rica and Iceland. Many  other countries also have targets to be 100% renewable or at least carbon neutral in the future, whether these targets will be met is another question. But growth in renewables is strong, quadrupling over the past decade, solar and wind being leaders in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;distributed-grid&quot;&gt;Distributed Grid&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/powerwall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Powerwall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewables are getting cheaper than ever and so more and more people are are installing solar panels on their home. Distributed power generation is more resilient than traditional power generation as each node in the system can support it self however combining it with existing systems will give additional redundancy. Less energy also has to be produced too as energy will not be lost in transmission. Improving overall grid efficiency. Storing energy and using it in peak demand has also become more popular with products like the tesla powerwall, which are essentially supplemental batteries when the sun or grid is down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;energy-storage&quot;&gt;Energy storage&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not just individuals storing energy for later use, corporations and even utility companies are leveraging energy store solutions to meet peak demand or reduce energy bills at scale. Supply can be increased as soon as there is demand unlike traditional power stations where this would take several minutes. This would likely be controlled by algorithms which predict when demand will increase or decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;electric-cars&quot;&gt;Electric Cars&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/car.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nissan Leaf&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric cars will increase the demand for electricity, however they are a cleaner alternative to their fossil fuelled counterparts as power stations tend to be more efficient than car engines. This might also provide a positive for the industry as this is a distributed energy store and could act as a massive battery bank when there is peak demand. Which is likely when people are home in the after noon. This is a bit more in the future but a really innovative solution, as this would have huge infrastructure cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable is the future and other energy sources are finding it harder to compete, even nuclear with it‚Äôs zero carbon emissions is relatively expensive when it comes to renewables. But storage technology will need to improve before we can go 100% renewable energy, that or perfect nuclear fusion. Which ever comes first.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Antony</name></author><category term="opinion" /><summary type="html">The future of energy will rely on technology more than ever.

Let me introduce you to &lt;a href=&quot;#Sirius&quot;&gt;Sirius Minerals&lt;/a&gt; the FTSE 250 traded company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a shout out to Hull Uni for letting me know through their &lt;a href=&quot;https://hull.jobteaser.com&quot; title=&quot;Job Teaser&quot;&gt;jobteaser platform&lt;/a&gt;. So the week after I got the job I moved to Scarborough for 2 months. Honestly it was a fast but 100% worth it for the experience I gained in those 2 months. &lt;a name=&quot;Sirius&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sirius-minerals&quot;&gt;Sirius Minerals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius Minerals is a fertilizer development company. Most people would describe it as a mining company, and I wouldn‚Äôt blame them they are developing mine, so it makes sense. They‚Äôre a start-up but a billion-dollar start-up so I was pretty excited to join the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:centre&quot;&gt;Every start up needs a ping pong table...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/sirius_social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Social Space&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission is really to ensure food security for the world for a minimum of another 50 years so for a project of this scale with an estimated 9.7 billion mouths to feed by 2050, you can really see why investing in this area is key. Contracts and trails are already been signed or in progress from India all the way to Argentina. The main product is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poly4.com&quot;&gt;POLY4&lt;/a&gt; which contains 4 of 6 macronutrients(potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium) that all plants need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;it-or-bi-in-a-vm&quot;&gt;IT or BI in a VM..?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From day one I had to run a virtual machine, obviously this would have a performance impact, but my setup wasn‚Äôt bad‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/sirius_setup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, Thunderbolt daisy chain too and i7 of course and 16GB standard, I wasn‚Äôt a fan of Thinkpads but it has grown on me. Open source software was dominant here, being a start up after all it‚Äôs important to keep overhead low. Most of their servers run on Ubuntu so I had to have one for development purposes, but I have to say my preferred flavour of Ubuntu has to be POP OS. A virtual machine with an SSD works really well, much better than my previous experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unix experience was so good that I even have it installed on my personal machine. It‚Äôs very convenient to have one installed just in case you have to run a Linux utility; Docker containers in particular in my case are so good they have become my preferred installation medium. And this does away with the Windows pro requirement which is just obnoxious. Being new to this stuff made it a learning curve but everyone was really helpful, and the GM of technology even sat down with me to help me with some cron jobs I was having trouble with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coded my first ever Java project, an application that consumes a REST API from a popular task management system and exports this to a Postgres database. Now this is very useful for backup but also allows for the application of Business Intelligence software. In my case this was Metabase, an open source, modern BI solution built on Clojure, but I did go on to run some tests on Apache Superset and Redis. Elasticsearch + Kibana looked very promising and was very polished but required a NoSQL to be maintained along side our Postgres database so it was unsuitable in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now most data scientists code in Python so that was the next thing on my list. I spent a week learning a very different programming language and it‚Äôs become one of my favourites syntactically. I produced less verbose code compared to either Java or C#, and with my data mining module next year I know it could be very useful, not to mention machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this being my first internship I‚Äôm truly grateful that I had the opportunity to join the team and be part of something that will have a lasting impact on a local and global scale, and hopefully they‚Äôll have a placement or a grad student next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Here‚Äôs a list of things you can connect to that I found during my time here. If you don‚Äôt have your login bookmark this for later and if you find it useful a share would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;timetables&quot;&gt;Timetables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing on this list, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://timetables.scientia.hull.ac.uk/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fdefault.aspx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or use the IHull app which you can find on the app store. Or you could do it the better way‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the ical feed below and attach it to your calendar, this will sync nicely with your timetable. I recommend google calendar, but any good calendar will support an ical feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;webcal://calendars.hull.ac.uk/tcs/Stucal.asp?p1=2017*****
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number at the end is your student number, it starts with the year you joined and it‚Äôs on your student card, note this is NOT the number underneath the barcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com&quot; title=&quot;Google Calendar&quot;&gt;google calendar&lt;/a&gt; open it on a laptop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the settings cog then settings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add calendar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From URL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copy and paste the link replacing the 2017***** with your student number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait a minute, the first sync takes longer than usual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should end up with something that resembles this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/calendar-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Calendar Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook also have ical feeds for events, something which societies use a lot, canvas too, but some modules spam the calendar making it unusable.
The rest of this tutorial is based on google calendar so if you‚Äôre having trouble just switch. Then you‚Äôll have a calendar that looks as good as this, plus it‚Äôs amazing for productivity once you sync up everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can sync your uni Email to your phone, very handy for people who forget to check their emails, I use Gmail but any client should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to settings and add account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select Exchange or Office 365&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your email is actually your computer login with @hull.ac.uk E.g 554537@hull.ac.uk. The newer emails may just work as the actual email these are from 2018 onwards with only @hull.ac.uk at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your password is your computer login password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow admin rights (a bit worrying yes but oh well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server settings should get automatically get picked up but if you‚Äôre having trouble here is my entire config.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/email-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Email Screenshot&quot; /&gt;
This also sync your calendar events to google calendar if you have an android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wifi&quot;&gt;Wifi&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university says get an installer from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cat.eduroam.org/&quot; title=&quot;Eduroam&quot;&gt;Eduroam Cat&lt;/a&gt; and I support them, it works but your mileage may vary, Just select Hull uni and download the installer the login is the login described in the process below. But a PC connection is simple enough you don‚Äôt need a installer‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;connect to Eduroam and it‚Äôll prompt you for a username and password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your username is your computer login with @hull.ac.uk E.g 554537@hull.ac.uk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your password is your computer login password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact, Eduroam will work on campuses across 101 countries, I found this out when I was in Dublin. To connect all you other devices you use the same login, but you‚Äôll probably have to go into advanced connection setting. If you get less that 20Mb/s cry, you can test your speed &lt;a href=&quot;https://speed.leons.dev&quot; title=&quot;Speed Test&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, if you use a custom DNS, Eduroam will not work, this is probably because they want to track your activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can get office for free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/education/products/office&quot; title=&quot;Office&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And all other software is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_cs=1&amp;amp;cmi_mnuMain=433748da-f0a6-e811-8109-000d3af41938&amp;amp;ws=8fabf8c8-de0b-e211-bd05-f04da23e67f6&amp;amp;vsro=8&quot; title=&quot;OnTheHub&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You use your university email and password to login but IT is a bit slow so it may take a few weeks to activate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;get-your-files&quot;&gt;Get your files&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most complicated one, the university has &lt;a href=&quot;http://box.hull.ac.uk&quot; title=&quot;box&quot;&gt;box&lt;/a&gt; for cloud storage, but do not have box sync installed so it‚Äôs basically useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do provide a VPN so you can access your drives like you‚Äôre at uni, I was going to talk about it but it‚Äôs down/broken and without screenshots it‚Äôs hard to tell you how to do it, but you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://share.hull.ac.uk/Services/ICT/SitePages/VPN%20-%20Working%20Remotely.aspx&quot; title=&quot;VPN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Login using your computer login. If you‚Äôre on Eduroam you just need to map your drives and it will just work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;random&quot;&gt;Random&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I covered everything, 2 more unrelated things 
I would recommend is Monzo, the app only bank which you can read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.leons.dev/better-banking&quot; title=&quot;Monzo Blog&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and sign up &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.monzo.com/r/m4oo8cy&quot; title=&quot;Join Monzo&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Splitting bills and creating a tab for your house are extremely useful for students, me and my friends already have a tab set up and we haven‚Äôt even moved in yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre a computer scientist get the GitHub Student pack &lt;a href=&quot;https://education.github.com/pack&quot; title=&quot;student pack&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs so much better than SVN. It even does static web hosting for free, so I recommend making a website. Here‚Äôs a little secret, my entire site costs ¬£10 a year to run and helped me land a internship so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good investment, you can read more about that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.leons.dev/tooling&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Antony</name></author><category term="project" /><summary type="html">You‚Äôre going to uni, Hull uni. Here‚Äôs a list of things you can connect to that I found during my time here. If you don‚Äôt have your login bookmark this for later and if you find it useful a share would be nice.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Better Banking</title><link href="https://blog.leons.dev/better-banking" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Better Banking" /><published>2019-04-06T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-06T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://blog.leons.dev/better-banking</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.leons.dev/better-banking">&lt;p&gt;Most banks are terrible, &lt;a href=&quot;#Monzo&quot;&gt;Enter Monzo&lt;/a&gt;, you can scroll to the header if you don‚Äôt want to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks, most people hate them but they do provide a service for modern society, with most offering free accounts you can open at any time. I have multiple bank accounts, they have different perk or just have really cool cards and I think I enjoy collecting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are some newcomers‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/Fintech.png#full&quot; alt=&quot;Fintech banks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an ISA with Halifax for like 4 or 5 years but every year they reduced the interest rate, when I was legally a child they give you a better rate for whatever reason but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs to hook you early. Why get you early? It‚Äôs a savings accounts, nobody really checks their savings account, they can lower rates and nobody bats an eyes.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/monzo2.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Halifax interest&quot; /&gt;
Banks are a business and this is capitalism so it makes sense. What doesn‚Äôt make sense is you can renew your account. What does that mean? Well you can ‚Äòrenew your interest rate‚Äô, Doing this &lt;strong&gt;TRIPLED&lt;/strong&gt; my rate to 0.6% but why this doesn‚Äôt happen automatically.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/monzo1.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Renewed rate&quot; /&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;Monzo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;enter-monzo&quot;&gt;Enter Monzo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monzo is ‚ÄúThe bank of the future‚Äù It‚Äôs now my primary bank account and it‚Äôs just launched ISAs so I ditched Halifax and moved straight over. Now your probably wondering what makes it different.
Well..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instant nonfictions when you spend and receive money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freeze your card whenever you want&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Verify big purchases with a notification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split bills with your friend instantly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ISA‚Äôs with 1.14% and paid monthly and next day withdrawal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A custom &lt;a href=&quot;https://monzo.me/antonyleons&quot; title=&quot;My link&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; where you can get paid right into your account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transparency, Everything is in plain English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs an actual bank that gets regulated by the government, you get everything you normally get just no branches which saves them a lot of money, money they then use to give you better rates and services, this is technology disrupting industry and I love it. Why Monzo? Well I‚Äôve tried a lot of fintech banks and it hands down comes out on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a disclaimer but you need to have ¬£500 to open an ISA and this is only open the UK residents, but just to sweeten the deal
get ¬£5 for signing up after your first transaction using this &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.monzo.com/r/m4oo8cy&quot; title=&quot;Get ¬£5&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if anything go &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.monzo.com/r/m4oo8cy&quot; title=&quot;Get ¬£5&quot;&gt;get ¬£5&lt;/a&gt; even if I haven‚Äôt sold you the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you wanna read more head over to their website &lt;a href=&quot;https://monzo.com/&quot;&gt;monzo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Antony</name></author><category term="opinion" /><summary type="html">Most banks are terrible, Enter Monzo, you can scroll to the header if you don‚Äôt want to read.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tooling</title><link href="https://blog.leons.dev/tooling" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tooling" /><published>2019-03-29T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-29T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://blog.leons.dev/tooling</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.leons.dev/tooling">&lt;p&gt;To make this site I had a lot of help, Without the work of over 1385 people this would not look the same, these are the tools they created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin I just want to say this is not for absolute beginners, learning everything takes time so don‚Äôt worry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway onwards to tooling;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io&quot; title=&quot;A Code Editor&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot; title=&quot;Hosting &amp;amp; Management&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And realistically that‚Äôs all you need I recommend you download &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub desktop&lt;/a&gt; to make you life easier. And if you have knowledge of HTML and CSS that‚Äôs all you need to create a site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey this blog is complicated I‚Äôm not going to write all of this code am I.
So here‚Äôs some more tools I used to make my life easier and the code simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot; title=&quot;Blog Generator&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.gohugo.io/&quot; title=&quot;Landing Page Generator&quot;&gt;GoHugo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domains.google&quot; title=&quot;Domain Registrar&quot;&gt;Google Domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com&quot; title=&quot;CDN and SSL&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com&quot; title=&quot;Analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/measure&quot; title=&quot;Automated Testing&quot;&gt;Measure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org&quot; title=&quot;Continuous Integration&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the tools I used, sure there are alternatives but I found these to work well and I‚Äôm now stuck in the ecosystem these tools provide. CloudFlare, Google Analytics, Measure and Travis CI are not necessary but they are useful tools you can add for the management of the site. All of these tools except your domain is free so why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly next week I‚Äôll go over the more of the setup and the structure of my site, feel free to follow along. Technically you could do it all yourself now by reading the documentation on all the tools and deploy your site so if you‚Äôre a skilled developer go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Antony</name></author><category term="project" /><summary type="html">To make this site I had a lot of help, Without the work of over 1385 people this would not look the same, these are the tools they created.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to My Blog</title><link href="https://blog.leons.dev/welcome" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to My Blog" /><published>2019-03-19T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-19T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://blog.leons.dev/welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.leons.dev/welcome">&lt;p&gt;Hey! Welcome to my blog, it‚Äôs great to have you :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an intro into how and why I created my website, the tools I used and future improvements I‚Äôm figuring out how to do.
I‚Äôll give a brief overview of costing(a lot less than you think), and maybe I‚Äôll write some tutorial over summer depending on
how bored I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow my socials or bookmark this page and check in every month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll also be publishing opinion pieces but they‚Äôll be tagged appropriately so I can save you some time.&lt;/p&gt;
