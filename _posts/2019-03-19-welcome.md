Hey! Welcome to my blog, it's great to have you :)

This is just an intro into how and why I created my website, the tools I used and future improvements I'm figuring out how to do.
I'll give a breif overview of costing(a lot less than you think), and maybe I'll write some tutorial over summer depending on
how bored I am.

This post will probably be finished at a later date because I have deadlines and I've been really busy
plus this is a side project so I only work on it a few hours a week if I can.

I'll also be publishing opinion piece but they'll be tagged appropriately so I can save you some time.

But if you're here cheers for browsing to my blog and stay tuned for updates
