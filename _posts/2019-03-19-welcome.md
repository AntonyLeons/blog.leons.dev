Hey! Welcome to my blog, it's great to have you :)

This is just an intro into how and why I created my website, the tools I used and future improvements I'm figuring out how to do.
I'll give a brief overview of costing(a lot less than you think), and maybe I'll write some tutorial over summer depending on
how bored I am.

Follow my socials or bookmark this page and check in every month or so.

I'll also be publishing opinion pieces but they'll be tagged appropriately so I can save you some time.

But if you're here cheers for browsing to my blog and stay tuned for updates
