I landed an internship this summer, I know I was surprised too. Let me introduce you to [Sirius Minerals](#Sirius).

Also a shout out to Hull Uni for letting me know through their [jobteaser platform](https://hull.jobteaser.com) "Job Teaser". So the week after I got the job I moved to Scarborough for 2 months. Honestly it was a fast but 100% worth it for the experience I gained in those 2 months. <a name="Sirius"></a>

# Sirius Minerals
Sirius Minerals is a fertilizer development company. Most people would describe it as a mining company, and I wouldn’t blame them they own a mine, so it makes sense. They’re a start-up but a billion-dollar start-up so I was pretty excited to join the team. Their main product is [POLY4]( https://www.poly4.com) which contains 4 of 6 macronutrients(potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium) that all plants need. Anyway onwards to the technology...

# IT or BI in a VM..?
Virual Machines, Virtual machines everywhere, Most people hate them because they're slow, but this fixed it...
